                During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mark trained 90% of the
                boudoir photographers in Canada (boudoir photography is much
                different from wedding or family photography and requires
                specific expertise!).

                represents confidence, freedom, beauty, fun, and playfulness,
                but she has also been known to be a bit mischievous at times!
