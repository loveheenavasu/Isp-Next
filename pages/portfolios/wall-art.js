                Having art on your walls is the personal touch, giving your
                walls a flavour unique to you. Women put personal images up for
                very different reasons. The room itself lends to different looks
                too. It is a reminder of your power and confidence. In the
                tumble of the day, our sense of self can get bruised a bit. An
                image reflecting back to you your true spirit lifts you up. In a
                bedroom a more daring, sultry nude or boudoir image sets the
                mood. Here it reminds you of your sensuality, how sexy you are.
                The right look shows your sensual side is more than skin deep
                :it’s how you express yourself. Living and dining rooms are
                great for those sweeping emotional images with rich colors that
                warm a room. Here you can switch it up with something artsy and
                dramatic or go earthy and quiet. Family rooms are where the
                playful images go, something fun that flavours the room with
                joy. The nice thing about photographs is they are easy to change
                seasonally. We do that in our home, loving the change it gives
                for the season. We can break out of traditional sizes. Images
                can be all sorts of shapes to go anywhere, even to fit together
                creating a larger concept on the wall. Some women get nervous
                that a wall print could be seen as vain, self-indulgent but more
                often they are viewed with envy. The common comment is “If I
                looked that good it would be on my wall too!” It may take a few
                days to adjust to a large size image but after you do, you can
                never go back! A wall size print is amazing art. You do deserve
                that for yourself.
